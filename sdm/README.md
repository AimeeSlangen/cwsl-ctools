# Data Extraction Scripts for Statistical Downscaling Model

The data extraction (DXT) tool for Statisical Downscaling Model (SDM) are a set
of Python command-line scripts that takes a Change-of-Date (CoD) file and
generates reconstructed climate series based on the AWAP local observation
dataset. 

## Scope 
The DXT tool focuses on the raw data extraction part without any
post-processing. The complete steps to run a workflow of the DXT tool is listed
as follows:

1. User specify a set of paramters that are required to locate the corresponding
   CoD file:
    * Model (specify one model from a pre-defined list of 22 CMIP5 models)
    * Scenario (specify one scenario from a pre-defined list of 3 scenarios)
    * region (specify one region from a pre-defined list of 10 climate regions)
    * season (specify one season from a pre-defined list of 4 seasons)
    * predictand (specify one predictand from a pre-defined list of 3
      predictands)
2. The path to the CoD file is generated based on inputs from the previous
   step and the base directory of CoD storage.
3. The reconstructed climate series is generated by picking up data from the
   AWAP dataset according to contents of the CoD File.
4. The output data is saved as a NetCDF file.

To do its work, it assumes the CoD files and AWAP dataset are
in place. It generates the reconstructed climate series by picking up data from
the AWAP dataset according to the CoD information. The reconstructed data is
saved as NetCDF files as its final output.

For a given CoD file, it 
The date range, region coverage, predictand type of the output data are determined by the scenario ,
region, and season CoD file 

for a given combination of model, scenario, region, season and
predictand.
